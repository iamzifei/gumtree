# Gumtree coding test

## how to run

to run the project, using:

`npm install`

`npm start`

then try it in browser in [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Environment

`babel`, `webpack` and `express` for server side rendering, pretty usual.
`css-modules` for reusable css blocks, instead of using Sass.

a few improvements could be done later.

Also Facebook got a tool/script `create-react-app` which would be really handy for new project, instead of spending times on webpack setups.
